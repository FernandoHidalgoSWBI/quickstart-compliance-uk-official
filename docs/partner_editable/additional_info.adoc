== Test the deployment

To test your deployment, choose the link for *LandingPageURL* from the *Outputs* tab for the main stack, as shown in Figure 1. A new page opens in your browser.

This deployment builds a working demo of a multi-AZ WordPress site. To connect to the WordPress site, choose the URL provided for the WordPress application on the landing page. This URL is also available from the *WebsiteURL* link on the *Outputs* tab for the main stack.

*Note:* WordPress is provided for testing and proof-of-concept purposes only; it is not intended for production use. You can replace it with another application of your choice.

The landing page URL brings up the WordPress welcome page. You can install and test the WordPress deployment from here.

*Note:* The WordPress application included in this Quick Start deployment is for demo purposes only. Application-level security, including patching, operating system updates, and addressing application vulnerabilities, are the customer’s responsibility (see the https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/[AWS Shared Responsibility Model]). *For this Quick Start, we recommend that you delete the AWS CloudFormation stacks after your proof-of-concept demo or testing is complete.*

== Deleting the stacks

When you’ve finished using the baseline environment, you can delete the stacks. Deleting a stack, either via CLI and APIs or through the AWS CloudFormation console, removes all the resources created by the template for that stack. *The only exceptions are the S3 buckets for logging and backup. By default, the deletion policy for those buckets is set to “Retain,” so you have to delete them manually.*

*Important:* This Quick Start deployment uses nested AWS CloudFormation templates, so deleting the main stack will remove the nested stacks and all associated resources.

== Integrating with AWS Service Catalog

You can add the AWS CloudFormation templates for this Quick Start to AWS Service Catalog as portfolios or products to manage them from a central location. This helps support consistent governance, security, and compliance requirements. It also enables users to quickly deploy only the approved IT services they need.

For complete information about using AWS Service Catalog, see the http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/servicecatalog/[AWS documentation]. The following table provides links for specific tasks.
