Deploying this Quick Start builds a multiâ€“Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) network topology, a sample LAMP (Linux Apache MySQL PHP) application, and a scalable containerized outbound proxy in the AWS Cloud, as shown in figures 1, 2, and 3.

.Amazon VPC design depicting the integration of a production VPC that hosts application services, an internet VPC that provides both inbound and outbound connectivity, a shared-services VPC that supports common tools (for example, Active Directory), and an endpoint VPC that provides consolidated access to AWS services and outbound access to the internet. The internet VPC can be replaced or enhanced to feature connectivity to a private government network.

The sample architecture includes the following components and features:

* Four Amazon virtual private clouds (VPCs), each with a mutiple Availability Zones (Multi-AZ) architecture:
    ** A production VPC for application workloads with private subnets to support shared services.
    ** A shared-services VPC with private subnets to support shared services (e.g., Active Directory).
    ** An internet VPC for controlled internet access with separate public and private communication channels.
    ** An endpoint VPC with private subnets to allow direct access to AWS services.
* AWS Transit Gateway for inter-VPC communication and virtual private network (VPN) termination.
* A peering connection for inter-VPC traffic between the internet VPC and endpoint VPC.
* Outbound proxies to handle external requests for logging and compliance.
* Standard Amazon VPC security groups (not shown) for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, load balancers, and endpoints.
* (Not shown) A LAMP (Linux Apache MySQL PHP) application using Auto Scaling and Elastic Load Balancing, which can be modified or bootstrapped using customer applications.
* Amazon GuardDuty for capture and analysis of security events and compliance.
* Logging, monitoring, and alerting using AWS Config rules, Amazon CloudWatch, and AWS CloudTrail.
* A basic AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) configuration with custom IAM policies, associated groups, roles, and instance profiles.
* AWS Security Hub for audit compliance.
* Amazon Route 53, a resolver to manage the shared private Domain Name System (DNS) for shared services and endpoints across VPCs.
* AWS Systems Manager, a sessions manager for administrative access to production-VPC instances.
* AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to store and deploy Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates to endpoints (to enable encryption in transit).
