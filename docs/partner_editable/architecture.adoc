Deploying this Quick Start builds a multi-VPC network topology, a sample LAMP application and a scalable containerized outbound proxy solution in the AWS Cloud, as illustrated in Figures 2, 3 and 4.

Figure 2: AWS VPC design depicting integration of a production VPC to host application services, an internet VPC to provide both inbound and outbound connectivity (This could also be replaced or enhanced to feature connectivity to a private government network), a shared services VPC to support common tooling e.g. active directory, an endpoint VPC to provide consolidated access to AWS services and outbound access to the internet.

The sample architecture includes the following components and features:

* Basic AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) configuration with custom IAM policies, with associated groups, roles, and instance profiles.
* An external-facing Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) for controlled internet access with multi-AZ architecture and separate public and private communication.
* An internal-facing Amazon VPC for shared services (for example active directory) with multi-AZ architecture and private subnets to support shared services.
* An internal-facing Amazon VPC for PrivateLink endpoints to allow direct access to AWS services over the AWS backbone with multi-AZ architecture and private subnets to support shared services.
* An internal-facing Amazon VPC for application workloads with multi-AZ architecture and private subnets to support shared services.
* AWS Transit Gateway for inter-VPC communication and VPN termination.
* Standard Amazon VPC security groups for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, load balancers and endpoints used in the sample application stack.
* LAMP (Linux Apache MySQL PHP) application using Auto Scaling and Elastic Load Balancing, which can be modified and/or bootstrapped with customer application.
* AWS Systems Manager, a sessions manager for administrative access to instances.
* Logging, monitoring, and alerting using AWS CloudTrail, Amazon CloudWatch, and AWS Config rules.
* Amazon Route 53 resolver to manage shared private DNS for shared services and endpoints across VPCs.
* AWS Certificate Manager to store and deploy SSL certificates to endpoints to enable encryption in transit.
* Capture and analysis of security events and compliance status using AWS GuardDuty.
* Audit compliance state across AWS with AWS Security Hub.
